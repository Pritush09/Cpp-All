#include<iostream>

// use #include<bits/stdc++.h> for all the competitive programming header files will be included and u dont have to include them individually 

//anything begins with the hash is a preprocess statement
//the first thing the compiler does when it gets a file isto preprocess all the preprocess statements
// using namespace std; # ye use karo agar harjagah std nahi use karna

int main(){
    // this << these operators are basically a function 
    //cout is basically what we want to show on the screen 
    std:: cout<<"HElloe" << std:: endl;
    //this get function waits for the usser to press the enter button 
    std:: cin.get();
}
//the main function is the special case for the which we dont have to return a typr value

/// the cpp files only gets compiled the header files doesnt gets compiled at all
